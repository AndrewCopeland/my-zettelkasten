# 1599712086 conjur-api-dot-net-usage

## Getting the .dll
I had to git clone the repo and build the solution from source.


Currently there is not .dll than can easily be downloaded from the releases or NuGet that I am aware of.


I found it slighlty difficult to find where the conjur api dll was outputed. After about 5 min of searching I found it. It is located `./conjur-api/bin/Release/conjur-api.dll` if your CWD is home of the repo.

## Creating my own solution
Created my own console application in visual studio.
Imported the library by adding a Reference.

Having issues with using a self signed certficiate. I might just have to add the self signed certificate to a windows certificate store?
